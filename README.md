📘 JetPy — The Power of Python, the Discipline of Java

JetPy is a modern programming language that blends the elegant simplicity of Python with the robust structure and performance of Java. It's designed to be both expressive and powerful — perfect for quick scripting and scalable systems alike.

🚀 Key Features
🧼 Clean Python-like syntax

🔐 Static typing with type inference

⚙️ Future support for JVM or native compilation

🧵 Built-in async/await and coroutines

🛠️ Low boilerplate, high readability

🧠 Scriptable, scalable, and easy to learn

🔧 Project Structure
JetPy currently includes:

A basic interpreter for prototyping

ANTLR4 grammar definitions (JetPy.g4)

CLI runner (jetc) for executing .jetpy files

Starter standard library and example scripts

📦 Usage
```python # Run a JetPy file
python jetc.py run examples/main.jetpy
```

📈 Roadmap
 Compile to Python bytecode or JVM

 Complete AST and code generation

 REPL and debugger support

 Package manager and module system

 JetPy standard library
